## **Steps to Recreate the Project**  


### **1. Data Cleaning**  
- Use Excel to clean and preprocess the data:  
- Remove duplicates and missing values.  
- Correct formatting issues (e.g., date formats, numerical values).  
- Normalize data for consistency.  

### **2. Data Transformation**  
- Perform transformations in Excel to prepare the data for analysis:  
- Create calculated fields if needed.  
- Organize data into a structured format (e.g., tables).  

### **3. Power BI Dashboard Creation**  
- Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.  
- Design an interactive dashboard by:  
- Creating visuals (e.g., bar charts, Graphs, KPIs).  
- Using slicers and filters to enable dynamic interaction.  
- Adding calculated measures using DAX for advanced insights.  

### **4. Insights and Analysis**  
- Highlight key findings from the dashboard, such as trends, patterns, or anomalies in the data.  

### **5. Final Output**  
- Export the Power BI dashboard as a .pbix file.  
- Share screenshots or publish the report to the Power BI service (if applicable).
